# Work in Progress!
This pages is currently under rework after, like, 4 years, so be patient!

# Who am I?

I'm currently in the middle of my PhD in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on
predictive world modeling for AI agents, under the supervision of
Prof. Aldo Gangemi.

I've also been participaring in [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/)
for a few years now, where we make robots play football, all on their own!
[Learn more about the competition](https://spl.robocup.org/) and

Besides that, I enjoy board games, RPGs of both the tabletop and video variety,
and writing code to solve my problems.



# Stuff I did

In which I show off my personal and academic projects that I like best
And I think would be interesting.

You can find more technical stuff on
[my GitHub profile](https://github.com/torchipeppo?tab=repositories).

## Masks of Babylon
A mini-JRPG where you explore a dungeon and fight battles with cool lighting effects!

One of my proudest creations from my time at university, a total of four students
worked during the summer to make this ~~Persona fangame~~ academic project.
Because name of the course is Interactive Graphics, and NOT Game Design,
the game itself is pretty barebones, but it features plenty of animations, textures,
and dynamic lighting effects during the battle scenes, a la Octopath Traveler.

[And you can play it right now](https://torchipeppo.github.io/masks-of-babylon/),
because it's a WebGL game!

## FitnessApp
Track your fitness with FitnessApp!

A **fictitious** full-stack website I and [a fellow student](https://github.com/Fulvio-P)
did as a project for a Web Technologies exam. I like how it turned out!

## Genesys Dice 3D
Roll dice for the Genesys tabletop roleplaying game, in a fully 3D environment!

An old, quick and dirty personal project, and my only use of the Unity game engine so far.
Includes several roll modes, interface customization options,
and a cool but useless gravity intensity setting.
The options menu is in Italian, but the rest of the interface relies on symbolic
icons and is thus language-independent.

[Try it out now!](./GenesysDice3D/)

## Tic-Tac-Toe on a Pepper Robot
Play a game with everyone's favorite robot!

A project for a Human-Robot Interaction course I did with two other students.
Apart from the game, this includes many interaction features such as gestures,
voice recognition commands, a web interface to show the game state on Pepper's tablet,
and even an adaptive difficulty system to ensure the best experience for each user.

Needless to say, you need a Pepper robot to run this, but we made a comprehensive demo video:

## //TODO add the rest of the projects

As stated, this page is still under renovations, so this list is not complete yet.
